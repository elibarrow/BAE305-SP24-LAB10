# Lab Report 10 - Data Informatics

## Summary of Lab 10 ##
In Lab 10: Data Informatics we began by setting up our own github page and forking a repo. I had already setup my github page a long time ago so there was not much to do for that part of the assignment. For the second part of the assignment I learned how to fork a repository by former Purdue student Yang Wang's YouTube video that was provided in the Lab file. Then for the third part of the assignment I opened a text file containing a poem, I then wrote some code to reverse the order of the characters in the poem to write it backwards. 

## Complete Code Used in Lab 10 ##

The code that I edited that had previously been provdided to me for the Lab can be found at this link or inside my Lab 10 repository.

**NOTE:** I am leaving out the inserted code snippets due to its length.

## Conclusion of Lab 10 ##

After completeing this Lab, the beginning was fairly trivial and not very difficult. The first two steps of the lab were laid out very clearly in the document, which lead to very little confusion. However once I had moved on to the third part of the Lab, where I began writing code, it was more involved. This part of the lab I opened the PLimerick text file and then wrote a few lines of code that would return the poem backwards. After completing a few test runs while using the word bananas and having troubles getting the kernel to work properly, I was able to complete part 3. I think this part of the lab was difficult for me mostly because of my unfamiliarity with Python, although this was frustrating at first at the end of the lab I had learned many new operations that I could use in Python in the future.
